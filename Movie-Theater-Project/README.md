### Welcome to my Movie Theater Website project repository!

The purpose of this repository is to store my project files for the Movie Theater Showtimes Website.

- This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
