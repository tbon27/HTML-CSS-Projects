					<p>Hyrule's history is long and storied, beginning with the Golden Goddesses creating the larger world that it resides in and spanning three separate timelines. Eternal and constant throughout the history of Hyrule is the presence of a hero sometimes chosen by the Goddesses themselves to fight the various people and creatures that threaten to destroy or dominate the land.</p>

		<h2 id="About Section">About Hyrule</h2>
		<p>
		The Kingdom of Hyrule, also simply known as Hyrule,the Land of the Gods,the Lesser Kingdom of Hyrule,the Surface, and Hyrule Kingdom, is the name of the kingdom that serves as the iconic setting for a majority of the games in the Zelda series. It is usually depicted as a beautiful and prosperous land blessed with deep forests, tall mountains, vast lakes, a barren desert, great cities, villages, and many ancient temples hidden throughout.
		<br>
		<br>
		Once ruled by the goddess Hylia as an unnamed land in ancient times, it became established as the Kingdom of Hyrule by the descendants of her mortal incarnation. The sacred bloodline that was started by the Zelda of Skyward Sword would go on to become known as the Royal Family of Hyrule. At the northern center of Hyrule is seated Hyrule Castle, where the family reside, and a bustling town surrounded by a stonewall, populated mostly by the Hylians and a variety of shops. To the west of the kingdom can often be seen a desert, forests to the south and south-east and a mountain range to the east and north-east.
		<br>
		<br>
		The kingdom has its own long and unique history with many wars and conflicts over the Triforce, deities, legendary relics, historical heroes and villains. It is connected to a variety of different realms or universes via magical artifacts and portals, including but not limited to the Sacred Realm, the Twilight Realm, its own direct parallel world Lorule and, to a lesser extent, Termina. The story of the Sacred Realm and the Triforce would shape Hyrule's future in the centuries that followed its establishment, becoming the basis of its providence. It is also home to a multitude of different races and tribes, each inhabiting a different part of the country and sometimes protecting its legendary relics and guarding its temples.
